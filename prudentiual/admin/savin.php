<DIV align=justify>If you’re not using a web hosting service, choose a web server and install it on your local computer or on a remote computer. Windows users who want to develop ColdFusion web applications can use the web server included in the developer edition of the ColdFusion MX 7 application server, which you can install and use for free. For more information, see Installing a ColdFusion application server.<BR><BR></DIV>
<DIV align=justify>Other Windows users can run a web server on their local computer by installing IIS. This web server may already be installed on your system. Check your folder structure to see if it contains a C:\Inetpub or D:\Inetpub folder. IIS creates this folder during installation. If you want to install IIS, see Installing a Web Server in Getting Started with Dreamweaver. &nbsp;</DIV></TD>
